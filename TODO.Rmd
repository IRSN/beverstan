## New features
	
- Implement the `show` method for the `"TVGEVBayes"` class.	
	
- Implement `confInt` or `credInt` method for the `"TVGEVBayes"`
  class.
  
- Implement `residuals` (a.k.a; `resid`) method for the `"TVGEVBayes"`
  class to display the generalized residuals.
  
- What about some Information Criterion, e.g. WAIC (*Widely
  Applicable* or *Watababe Akaike*) Information Criterion?
		
- Implement the `simulate` method for the `"TVGEVBayes"` class. How to
  cope with the parameters? We could either plug the MAP parameter or
  sample the parameter from the its posterior, hence simulate from the
  predictive distribution.

- Allow the `predict` method for the `"TVGEVBayes"` class to compute
  the density or other "predict" things as done in the *revdbayes*
  package.
  
- Allow the `predict` method for the `"TVGEVBayes"` class to compute
  the distribution or density, ... on *several* time ranges. The
  `autoplot` method could then plot e.g. the densities as is done in
  the *NSGEV* package.

- Implement the methods wanted in the **stan** packages such as
  `posterior_predict`.  

- What about the implementation of random effects as in **INLA**:
  random walk, integregrated random walk, AR, ...
  
## Known problems

- The initial values for the MCMC sampling may fail to match the data.
  These are obtained by applying a small perturbation on the
  parameters computed by ML and it may be the cas that the support of
  the GEV distributions does not cover all the observations, leading
  to an error. The solution would be to write a quite sophisticated
  function to get initial values.

- The \code{predict} method for the class \code{"TVGEVBayes"} may
  fail. The problem is that the quantiles of the predictive
  distribution are obtained by using \code{uniroot} on the which
  requires suitable lower and upper bounds for the root.  These bounds
  are obtained by an heuristic which needs imporvements. The solution
  may be first to sample from the predictive distribution (which is
  easy) and simply take the maximum and the minimum of the simulated
  values as the bounds.

  
## Improvements

- The `autoplot` method for `TVGEVBayes` could have a `which` argument
  controlling the type of plot. The posssible values would be:
  `fitted` (default) `RL`, `predict` and `residuals`. Depending of the
  value of `which` we would first call the corresponding method and
  the arguments passed through the dots `...` would be passed to the
  corresponding method. Each of these main methods would return an
  object with a corresponding class (e.g. `fitted.TVGVBayes`)
  inheriting from `"data.frame"` with some extra attributes to keep
  trace of the choices: `timeRange`, `level`, `what` (for what is
  predicted), ... Note that this is some kind of refactoring.
   
- Improve the management of the blocks. A duration of several years
  could be allowed. The beginning of the blocks could also be chosen
  differently if needed, for instance at the 1-st of August in order
  to allow a better management of winter extremes. This could be done
  by using a syntax like `blockBegin = "08-01"`.

- Define a class `"ibts"` for irregularly sampled block time series.
  Each observation would correspond to a time-block such as one year,
  and the blocks would be given in time order but with possible gaps.
  We could allow interval censored observations; the name of the
  variable would then no longer be a colname but be attached as an
  attribute to the object. So the columns could be named Ì€"y"`, `"yL"`
  and `"yU"` without having some complex management of suffixes and
  prefixes.
   
## Technical solutions

- Study the code of some packages like **brms** to see how to achieve
  gains in the use of **Stan**. Also instructions collected from the
  **rstantools** package documentation can help.
